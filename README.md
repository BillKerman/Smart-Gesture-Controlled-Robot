# Smart-Gesture-Controlled-Robot
 Developed a user-friendly Hand gesture-controlled rover which precisely interprets the userâ€™s hand orientation based about three-axis wrist rotation using the MPU 6050 accelerometer integrated with Master Arduino. These commands are thenrelayed using HC05S Bluetooth modules to the slave Arduino, equipped with LN298 motor drivers to command the rover
