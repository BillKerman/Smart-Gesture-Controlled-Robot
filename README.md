# Smart-Gesture-Controlled-Robot
Developed a gesture-controlled rover for astronauts in bulky EVA suits. It uses MPU6050 sensors with Arduino to interpret three-axis wrist rotation for precise commands. HC05S relays commands to LN298 motor-driven rover. Install the required libraries compile the code in Aurdino IDE and Upload to master and slave AurdinoUNOs.
